             <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p class="fw-bold">Amidst a panoramic, HyperWheelz was founded by Ezequiel Hernandez in 2022. It all started when Professor Jennifer Jin assigned the engineers to group four on one fateful day. </p>
      <p class="lh-1">One man's vision to create the best car dealership with the fairest prices for electric cars. Along the way they utilized the lessons that they learned from CSE 4550. They built a business using team management, hard work, and first hand experience with html, css, django, and github. It was quite a journey for these engineers. HyperWheelz will become a household name for all CSUSB students as gas prices raise and students go broke. Electric cars will be the car the future. By Spring 2022 we hope to provide the best user experience in the city of San Bernardino. </p>

<p class="fw-bold"> Why choose us? </p>
   <p class="lh-1">We offer the best deals on electric cars along with student discounts for coyote students. GO COYOTES! Since gas cost an arm and a leg these days, electric cars will be more cost-efficient. According to Feilding Cage, The long road to electric cars, “Less than 1% of the 250 million cars, SUVs and light-duty trucks on the road in the United States are electric.” Looking at the IHS Markit industry analysis about 45% of cars sales could be electric by 2035. Our company is 13 years ahead of everyone else.</p>
